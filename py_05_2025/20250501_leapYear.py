Leap Years (Divisible by 4, and follow the rules):
2000 (Divisible by 400, so it's a leap year)

2016 (Divisible by 4, not divisible by 100)

2020 (Divisible by 4, not divisible by 100)

2400 (Divisible by 400, so it's a leap year)

❌ Non-Leap Years (Failing one or more of the leap year conditions):
1900 (Divisible by 100 but not 400)

2100 (Divisible by 100 but not 400)

2023 (Not divisible by 4)

2019 (Not divisible by 4)
